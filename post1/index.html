				<h2>Project Description</h2>
				<p>
				<b>Project Overview</b></br>
				The aim of this project is to create an overview of immigration into the United States and investigate
				the effect it has on the economy and current citizens. We will specifically examine the impact of immigration on the unemployment rate
				and wages of non-immigrants, both on a national and state level.
				</p>
				<p>
				<b>Hypothesis</b></br>
				We hypothesize that as immigrants, both legal and illegal, entered the United States, the non-immigrant unemployment
				rate increased and wage rate decreased, especially for low-skilled workforces.
				</p>
				<b>Collected Data</b></br>
				So far we have collected immigration data from the years 1998 to 2015, organized by year and the continent
				the immigrants came from. We also have a data on the number of legal permanent residents per year, in addition to a wide range of US census data specifying wages, occupations, industries, employment rates, and numerous other metrics broken across multiple demographics.</br>
				</p>
				<h2>Graphs and sample code</h2>
				<h3>Sample code for working with data</h3>
				<p>We will use code like the following to convert the excel data into data that can be easily processed by our algorithms.</p>

				<h3>Image of Permanent Resident Data</h3>

				<h3>Image of Immigrants vs Unemployment</h3>

				<br>
				<br>
				<p>This graph plots the number of legal immigrants against the average yearly unemployment rate in the US from 1948 to 2015. We plan to run numerous correlation/machine learning algorithms on this general data set to extract conclusions about the relationship of these two metrics.</p>
				<h3>Foreign Born Labor Force</h3>

				<br>
				<p>We include this graph (from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_Act_of_1990#/media/File:Chart_of_foreign_born_in_the_US_labor_force_1900_to_2007.png">Wikipedia</a>) as supporting background information for our research question.</p>
				<h2>Next Steps</h2>
				<p> 
					<li>Run correlation and regression algorithms on immigration vs. unemployment data.</li>
					<li>Look for additional data, clean and integrate with existing data.</li>
					<li>Produce at least one visualization based on the cleaned database to test our hypothesis.</li>
