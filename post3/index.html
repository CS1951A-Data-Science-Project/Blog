				</div>
				<h3>Overview</h3>
				<p>
					Given the short amount of time between this and our previous blog post, there is not much to report in the way of further progress on visualizing/analyzing our existing data. However, we have spent some time to determine the final steps for this project, in addition to considering other potential questions within our research topic. The next few weeks promise to be an exciting endeavor as we seek to answer our initial questions and hopefully make a final conclusion on our initial hypotheses.
				</p>
				<h3>Additional Research Questions</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>
							As another topic for our project to explore, we plan to look at the breakdown between legal and illegal immigration. Relevant data may include the number of border arrests and the amount of funding spent on border control. While the exact amount of illegal immigration is difficult to ascertain, the number of attempted crossings stopped with respect to the amount of border control funding serves as a heuristic estimate of the change in illegal immigration over time. The new datasets we plan on using to answer this question include “Illegal Immigrants Arrested  by US Border Patrol” and “H-1B Visa Petitions.”
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Another potential topic within our research area we will investigate is refugee programs, a recent political target of the Trump administration. In the same vein as the illegal/legal immigration breakdown, we plan to look at whether refugees follow the same trends as the general immigration population or if there are statistically significant differences in terms of assimilation, economic success, etc.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Final Tasks on Core Research Questions</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>
							Make another visualization for the Final Report, most likely investigating the relationship between immigration and unemployment
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Apply statistical/regression analysis to immigration versus unemployment data
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Apply statistical/regression analysis to immigration versus crime rate data (and possibly incorporate this into our per-year visualization)
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
